# Crypto Technical Scanner

Crypto Technical Scanner is a web-based medium-to-large timeframe technical screening and research tool for Binance USDT spot markets.

It ranks markets by technical structure, volatility compression, confirmation strength, and risk context. It is not a trading bot and does not place trades.

## What It Does

- Scans Binance USDT spot markets by 24h quote volume.
- Focuses on larger market moves with supported timeframes `4h`, `1d`, `1w`, and `1M`.
- Uses `4h` as the minimum timeframe and `4h` + `1d` as the core multi-timeframe workflow.
- Calculates technical indicators from public candle data.
- Classifies each market into a neutral market phase.
- Produces opportunity, confirmation, risk, and rank scores.
- Explains why a symbol ranked, what would confirm the setup, and what would invalidate it.
- Displays a scanner table and a symbol detail chart.

## What It Does Not Do

- It does not place trades.
- It does not connect wallets.
- It does not request private exchange API keys.
- It does not manage portfolios.
- It does not provide financial advice, investment advice, trading recommendations, or profit guarantees.

## Current Status

Implemented MVP phases:

- Phase 1: Next.js App Router scaffold, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, routes, components, and base types.
- Phase 2: Binance public data layer for markets and candles.
- Phase 3: Indicator calculation layer.
- Phase 4: Scanner scoring and `/api/scan`.
- Phase 5: Scanner UI with filters, table, selection, refresh, and request states.
- Phase 6: Symbol detail page with candlestick chart and overlays.
- Phase 7: In-memory cache, TTLs, response metadata, concurrency limits, and partial scan errors.
- Phase 8: README, known limitations, and final validation.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Dependency versions are pinned in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`; do not
use `"latest"` ranges for Phase 1 stabilization work.

Open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/scanner`
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/symbol/binance/BTCUSDT`

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run build:cloudflare
npm run preview:cloudflare
npm run deploy:cloudflare
npm run start
```

The build script uses `next build --webpack` because the current local environment blocks a Turbopack build operation that attempts to bind a local port during CSS processing.

## Cloudflare Workers Deployment

This app is prepared for Cloudflare Workers deployment via OpenNext for Cloudflare.

Production mode on Cloudflare supports the remote Binance scanner:

```txt
/api/scan?source=remote
/api/scan/mtf?source=remote
```

Remote Binance is the default and sufficient scanner source for Phase 1. The app is a private real-time scanner, not a paid database warehouse. D1, full candle warehousing, historical backfill, and persistent scan history are out of scope unless a future database backend is added. Cloudflare Workers should run with:

```txt
DISABLE_LOCAL_SQLITE=true
DEPLOY_TARGET=cloudflare
```

These values are set in `wrangler.jsonc`. Cloudflare production uses Remote Binance only; local SQLite code is isolated behind local Node.js branches. `source=local` returns a friendly `501` in Cloudflare production.

Cloudflare commands:

```bash
npm run build:cloudflare
npm run preview:cloudflare
npm run deploy:cloudflare
```

D1 is not configured in `wrangler.jsonc` for Phase 1. The old migration workflow is intentionally removed.

### Cloudflare Free Batching

Cloudflare Workers Free can hit the external subrequest limit if one invocation scans hundreds of symbols. As a temporary Phase 1 solution, the Scanner UI processes full-market scans through sequential frontend batches:

- API form: `/api/scan?source=remote&timeframe=4h&batchMode=true&batchSize=35&cursor=0`
- MTF API form: `/api/scan/mtf?source=remote&preset=short&batchMode=true&batchSize=15&cursor=0`
- Single-timeframe default batch size: `35`
- Single-timeframe maximum API batch size: `40`
- MTF default batch size: `15`
- MTF maximum API batch size: `20`
- The frontend requests one batch at a time, merges results, deduplicates by symbol/timeframe, then sorts by `rankScore`.

MTF batches are smaller because each symbol needs candles for multiple timeframes. Numeric `maxSymbols` requests such as `maxSymbols=20` still use the normal single-call scan path. Workers Paid may remove the need for this batching later. D1, KV, R2, Queues, and Durable Objects are not required for this phase.

## Timeframes

The scanner is designed for medium-to-large timeframe coin selection, not intraday scalping.

Supported public scanner timeframes:

- `4h`
- `1d`
- `1w`
- `1M`

Unsupported lower timeframes intentionally return `400` from public scanner/candle APIs:

- `1h`
- `15m`
- `5m`
- `1m`

The core workflow is to scan eligible Binance USDT pairs on `4h`, confirm structure with `1d`, and optionally inspect `1w` and `1M`. Lower intervals were removed to reduce short-term noise and avoid unnecessary API/database load.

## Data Source

The MVP uses Binance public REST market data only.

The adapter reads from Binance's market-data endpoint:

```txt
https://data-api.binance.vision
```

This avoids regional restrictions that can affect `https://api.binance.com` in some locations. The app does not use private trading endpoints.

Market filtering:

- Includes `TRADING` spot markets quoted in `USDT`.
- Excludes stablecoin, fiat-like, commodity-like, and unsuitable bases such as `USDC`, `FDUSD`, `TUSD`, `BUSD`, `DAI`, `USDP`, `USDD`, `RLUSD`, `BFUSD`, `XUSD`, `USD1`, `USDE`, `SUSDE`, `FRAX`, `PAXG`, `XAUT`, `EUR`, `EURI`, `AEUR`, `BRL`, `TRY`, `UAH`, `ZAR`, `IDRT`, `BIDR`, and `U`.
- Excludes wrapped/staking duplicates such as `WBTC`, `WBETH`, and `BNSOL`.
- Excludes fan tokens such as `PSG`, `ATM`, `PORTO`, `LAZIO`, `SANTOS`, `ASR`, `ACM`, `BAR`, `JUV`, `CITY`, and `ALPINE`.
- Excludes leveraged token suffixes such as `UP`, `DOWN`, `BULL`, `BEAR`, `3L`, `3S`, `5L`, and `5S`, with explicit exceptions for legitimate symbols where needed.
- Sorts by 24h quote volume.

Scanner calculations use only fully closed candles. If Binance returns a currently forming latest candle, the scanner removes it before calculating indicators, scores, and rankings. Chart views may still request recent candles for display.

## Architecture

```txt
UI
  -> Next.js API routes
  -> Exchange adapter
  -> Indicator layer
  -> Scanner layer
  -> Explanation output
```

Important boundaries:

- Exchange access lives in `src/lib/exchanges`.
- Indicator calculations live in `src/lib/indicators`.
- Scanner phase, scoring, warnings, and explanations live in `src/lib/scanner`.
- Chart rendering lives in `src/components/chart`.
- UI state and tables live in `src/components/scanner` and `src/components/symbol`.

## Indicators

The indicator layer wraps `technicalindicators` and exposes app-owned functions.

Implemented:

- SMA20
- SMA50
- SMA200
- Bollinger Bands 20, 2
- Bollinger Band Width
- Bollinger Band Width Percentile over recent valid widths
- RSI14
- Volume MA20
- Volume MA50
- Quote Volume MA20 when Binance kline quote volume is available
- Volume Ratio 20 / 50
- Volume dry-up, expansion, abnormal spike, breakout confirmation, healthy pullback, and distribution-warning context
- MACD 12/26/9
- Price extension from MA20

MACD is used as a confirmation input for momentum improvement, crosses, and weakening warnings. It is not treated as a standalone trading signal. KDJ is intentionally not included in Phase 1 to avoid adding noisy or overfit confirmation layers.

Volume analysis uses the volume and quote-volume fields already included in Binance kline responses, so it does not add extra Binance requests. Volume acts as confirmation and risk context: breakout without volume is not treated as strong confirmation, quiet volume during compression is a setup/watchlist clue rather than confirmation, and abnormal volume spikes can increase risk when the structure is extended or distribution-like.

Short candle arrays return `null` for unavailable indicators instead of throwing.

## Scoring

Each scan result includes:

- `opportunityScore`
- `confirmationScore`
- `riskScore`
- `rankScore`

The rank score is only used for sorting:

```txt
rankScore =
  opportunityScore * 0.40 +
  confirmationScore * 0.40 -
  riskScore * 0.30 -
  phase/risk penalties
```

All component scores remain visible in the UI. Structure remains the base layer, while volume mainly adjusts confirmation and risk. Compression remains visible as a reason, but weak structures are capped so breakdowns or prices below both MA50 and MA200 are not ranked as high-opportunity solely because volatility or volume is compressed. The scanner remains a research/filtering tool, not a trading signal or execution system.

Market phases:

- `BASE_BUILDING`
- `SQUEEZE`
- `BREAKOUT_ATTEMPT`
- `BREAKOUT_CONFIRMED`
- `TRENDING`
- `PULLBACK_HEALTHY`
- `OVEREXTENDED`
- `DISTRIBUTION`
- `BREAKDOWN`

## API Routes

```txt
GET /api/markets?limit=100
GET /api/candles?source=remote&symbol=BTCUSDT&timeframe=4h&limit=300
GET /api/scan?source=remote&timeframe=4h
GET /api/scan?source=remote&timeframe=4h&maxSymbols=200&minQuoteVolume=10000000
GET /api/scan?source=remote&timeframe=4h&maxSymbols=all
GET /api/scan?source=remote&timeframe=4h&batchMode=true&batchSize=35&cursor=0
GET /api/scan/mtf?source=remote&preset=short
GET /api/scan/mtf?source=remote&preset=short&batchMode=true&batchSize=15&cursor=0
```

Responses include:

- `itemCount`
- `cached`
- `cacheTtlSeconds`
- `cacheExpiresAt`
- `updatedAt`
- `durationMs`
- `eligibleCount`
- `scannedCount`
- `failedCount`
- `usesClosedCandles`
- `lastClosedCandleTime`
- `failureSummary`

The scan route defaults to the full eligible Binance Spot USDT universe with a hard safety cap of 600 symbols. `maxSymbols` is optional and only narrows the scan universe when explicitly provided. It is not the number of displayed result rows. Leave it empty, set it to `ALL` in the UI, or pass `maxSymbols=all` for full-market selection. The UI defaults to displaying 50 rows while still scanning the full eligible universe. The scan route uses `p-limit` with concurrency `5`. If one symbol fails, the route returns partial results and a small sampled `errors` array.

Batch responses also include `batchMode`, `cursor`, `nextCursor`, `hasMore`, `batchSize`, `batchIndex`, `totalBatches`, `totalEligibleCount`, and `scannedInBatch`.

## Scanner Workbench

The `/scanner` page is a desktop-first compact technical workbench:

- Dense three-column layout: filters, results table, and selected-symbol inspector.
- Compact status bar shows source, mode, timeframe, scan progress, cache state, duration, and next refresh.
- The table is the primary surface for comparing symbols; it uses compact rows, sticky headers, O/C/R score cells, warning counts, MACD status, and inline MA indicators.
- The right inspector keeps detailed reasoning, warnings, volume context, next confirmation, invalidation, and data quality for the selected row.
- Full-market scans can process all eligible symbols while the default visible row count remains 50.

## Cache

The MVP uses process-local memory cache.

TTL values:

- Markets / exchangeInfo: 12 hours
- 24h tickers: 30 minutes
- 4h candles: 60 minutes
- 1d candles: 6 hours
- 1w candles: 24 hours
- 1M candles: 72 hours
- 4h scan: 60 minutes
- 1d scan: 6 hours
- 1w scan: 24 hours
- 1M scan: 72 hours

This cache resets when the server process restarts.

## Known Limitations

- The cache is in-memory and not shared across server instances.
- Scoring rules are MVP heuristics and should be tuned with observation.
- The scanner only supports Binance Spot USDT markets.
- Symbol detail supports 4h and 1d in the UI.
- There is no historical signal storage or backtesting.
- There are no user accounts or saved watchlists.
- `npm audit` currently reports a moderate advisory from Next's transitive `postcss <8.5.10` dependency. `npm audit fix --force` would install a breaking downgrade, so it has not been applied.

## Future Roadmap

v2:

- Watchlist with localStorage.
- Multi-timeframe alignment.
- BTC/ETH market regime filter.
- Better liquidity tiers.
- Better chart annotations.

v3:

- PostgreSQL and Prisma.
- Historical signal snapshots.
- Backtesting.
- Watchlist alerts.
- Additional exchange adapters.

v4:

- User accounts.
- Saved scanner templates.
- Custom scoring weights.
- Signal performance analytics.
