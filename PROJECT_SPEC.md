## How Codex Should Use This Document

Codex should follow this document in phases.

Do not implement the full product in one pass.

Recommended execution order:

1. Project initialization and folder structure
2. Binance public market-data layer
3. Indicator calculation layer
4. Scanner scoring layer
5. Scanner UI
6. Symbol detail page and charting
7. Caching, concurrency, and production hardening
8. Optional v2/v3 enhancements

For every phase, Codex must:

- Report changed files
- Explain implementation choices
- Run lint/build/typecheck where available
- Report known limitations
- Avoid adding unrequested features
- Avoid trading/order/wallet/private-key functionality

# Crypto Technical Scanner — Project Specification for Codex

> Version: v0.1 MVP Specification  
> Purpose: Build a crypto technical analysis scanner as a research and decision-support tool.  
> Important: This is **not** a trading bot, not a signal-selling site, and not financial advice.

## 0. Product Definition

### 0.1 One-sentence positioning

**Crypto Technical Scanner** is a web-based medium-to-large timeframe crypto market scanner that ranks Binance USDT spot pairs by technical structure, volatility compression, trend state, confirmation strength, and risk level.

### 0.2 What the product should do

The product should help the user answer:

- Which coins are entering volatility compression?
- Which coins are attempting a breakout?
- Which coins are trending cleanly?
- Which coins are overextended and risky?
- Which coins have weak or conflicting signals?
- What conditions would confirm or invalidate the current setup?

### 0.3 What the product must not do

Do **not** implement:

- Wallet connection
- Private exchange API keys
- Order placement
- Auto trading
- Copy trading
- Portfolio tracking
- Profit guarantees
- “Buy / Sell / Strong Buy” labels
- Financial advice language

Use neutral language:

- Observe
- Watch
- Breakout Attempt
- Confirming
- Trend Continuation
- Overextended
- Risk Warning
- Invalidated

### 0.4 First version scope

MVP scope:

- Exchange: Binance Spot only

- Output:
  - Market phase
  - Opportunity score
  - Confirmation score
  - Risk score
  - Rank score
  - Reasons
  - Warnings
  - Next confirmation
  - Invalidation

---

## 1. Recommended Technology Stack

### 1.1 Core stack

Use:

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui where useful
- TanStack Table for scanner result tables
- TanStack Query for frontend request state
- Lightweight Charts for candlestick charts
- technicalindicators for MVP indicator calculations
- p-limit for API concurrency control

### 1.2 Why this stack

Next.js is preferred over Astro for this project because the app is dynamic and API-heavy. It requires route handlers, server-side data fetching, caching, interactive filters, and later database-backed signal history.

### 1.3 External libraries to use

#### Data

- MVP: direct Binance public REST API
- Later: CCXT adapter for multi-exchange support

#### Indicators

- MVP: `technicalindicators`
- Alternative later: `trading-signals` or `ixjb94/indicators`

Important implementation rule:

> Do not call third-party indicator libraries directly from pages, components, or scanner logic. Wrap them inside `src/lib/indicators/`.

#### Charts

- Use `lightweight-charts` for candlestick and overlay lines.

#### Tables

- Use `@tanstack/react-table`.

#### Concurrency

- Use `p-limit`.
- Do not scan 100+ symbols with unrestricted `Promise.all`.

### 2.2 Main design principle

Separate the project into clean layers:

1. **Exchange layer**: fetches and normalizes market data.
2. **Indicator layer**: calculates pure technical indicators.
3. **Scanner layer**: converts indicators into phases, scores, warnings, and explanations.
4. **API layer**: exposes data to the UI.
5. **UI layer**: displays sortable, explainable results.

Do not mix these layers.

### 2.3 Cloudflare Workers Deployment Boundary

The stabilized MVP deploys to Cloudflare Workers via OpenNext for Cloudflare.

Cloudflare production supports the remote Binance scanner by default:

- `/api/scan?source=remote`
- `/api/scan/mtf?source=remote`

Remote Binance is the default and sufficient scan source for Phase 1. The app is a private real-time scanner, not a paid database warehouse. Paid D1 storage, full candle warehousing, historical backfill, and persistent scan history are out of scope unless a future database backend is added. Cloudflare production should set:

```txt
DISABLE_LOCAL_SQLITE=true
DEPLOY_TARGET=cloudflare
```

When those flags are active, Cloudflare production uses `source=remote` only. `source=local` and local sync routes return a friendly `501`. SQLite modules remain isolated behind local Node.js branches. D1 is future optional only and is not configured for Phase 1.

Cloudflare Workers Free has a strict external subrequest limit per Worker invocation. Full eligible-market scans must therefore use a temporary sequential frontend batching path in Phase 1:

- `/api/scan?source=remote&timeframe=4h&batchMode=true&batchSize=35&cursor=0`
- `/api/scan/mtf?source=remote&preset=short&batchMode=true&batchSize=15&cursor=0`
- Single-timeframe default batch size: `35`
- Single-timeframe maximum safe API batch size: `40`
- MTF default batch size: `15`
- MTF maximum safe API batch size: `20`
- The frontend requests one batch at a time, appends results, deduplicates, and sorts the final combined result set by `rankScore`.

MTF batches are smaller because each symbol requires candle requests for multiple timeframes such as `4h` and `1d`.

Do not add D1, KV, R2, Queues, Durable Objects, or database persistence for this temporary batching solution. Workers Paid may remove the need for frontend batching later.

### 2.4 Timeframe Boundary

The product is designed for medium-to-large timeframe coin selection during larger market moves, not intraday scalping.

Supported scanner, cache, and UI timeframes:

- `4h`
- `1d`
- `1w`
- `1M`

Unsupported lower intervals must return `400` from public scanner/candle APIs:

- `1h`
- `15m`
- `5m`
- `1m`

The default single scan timeframe is `4h`. The default multi-timeframe scan uses `4h` as the primary structure and `1d` as confirmation. `1w` and `1M` are optional higher-timeframe context. Lower intervals were intentionally removed to reduce short-term noise and reduce API/database load.

Scanner calculations must use fully closed candles by default. If Binance returns a latest candle whose `closeTime` is greater than the current server time, remove that candle before indicator calculation, scoring, warnings, and ranking. Responses may expose `usesClosedCandles` and `lastClosedCandleTime` for production diagnostics.

## 5. Exchange Layer

### 5.1 Files

```txt
src/lib/exchanges/types.ts
src/lib/exchanges/binance.ts
```

### 5.2 Required functions

```ts
getSpotMarkets(): Promise<Market[]>

get24hTickers(): Promise<Record<string, {
  symbol: string;
  quoteVolume: number;
  priceChangePercent: number;
}>>

getTopUsdtMarkets(limit?: number): Promise<Market[]>

getCandles(
  symbol: string,
  timeframe: Timeframe,
  limit?: number
): Promise<Candle[]>
```

### 5.3 Binance filtering rules

Only include symbols where:

- `status === "TRADING"`
- `quoteAsset === "USDT"`

Exclude:

- Stablecoin pairs
- Leveraged tokens
- Inverse/UP/DOWN/BULL/BEAR tokens
- Very low liquidity pairs if they appear in the top list accidentally

Stablecoin bases to exclude:

```ts
const EXCLUDED_BASE_ASSETS = new Set([
  "USDC",
  "FDUSD",
  "TUSD",
  "DAI",
  "USDP",
  "BUSD",
  "EUR",
  "AEUR",
  "PAX",
]);
```

Leveraged token patterns to exclude:

```ts
const LEVERAGED_PATTERNS = [
  "UP",
  "DOWN",
  "BULL",
  "BEAR",
  "3L",
  "3S",
  "5L",
  "5S",
];
```

Be careful not to incorrectly exclude legitimate symbols that merely contain these letters. Prefer checking suffixes where possible.

### 5.4 Candle normalization

Binance kline response must be normalized to:

```ts
{
  openTime: Number(k[0]),
  open: Number(k[1]),
  high: Number(k[2]),
  low: Number(k[3]),
  close: Number(k[4]),
  volume: Number(k[5]),
  closeTime: Number(k[6])
}
```

---

## 6. Indicator Layer

### 6.1 Files

```txt
src/lib/indicators/types.ts
src/lib/indicators/movingAverage.ts
src/lib/indicators/bollinger.ts
src/lib/indicators/rsi.ts
src/lib/indicators/volume.ts
src/lib/indicators/index.ts
```

### 6.2 Required exported function

```ts
calculateIndicatorSnapshot(candles: Candle[]): IndicatorSnapshot
```

### 6.3 Indicator requirements

Calculate:

- SMA20
- SMA50
- SMA200
- Bollinger Bands 20, 2
- Bollinger Band Width
- Bollinger Band Width Percentile over the last 90 valid width values
- RSI14
- Volume MA20
- Volume MA50
- Quote Volume MA20 when available
- Volume Ratio 20 / 50
- Volume dry-up, expansion, abnormal spike, breakout confirmation, healthy pullback, and distribution-warning context
- MACD 12/26/9
- Price extension from MA20

MACD is a conservative confirmation input only. It can support confirmation when histogram momentum improves, a bullish cross appears, or MACD remains above zero in constructive phases. It must not become a standalone trading signal. KDJ is intentionally excluded from Phase 1 to reduce noise and overfitting.

Volume analysis is a confirmation and risk layer, not a standalone trading signal. It uses the volume and quote-volume fields already returned by Binance klines, so it must not increase Binance requests. Breakout without volume is not strong confirmation, quiet volume compression is a setup/watchlist clue, and abnormal volume spikes can be risk when price is extended, closes weak, or shows distribution-like candles.

### 6.4 Null behavior

If there is insufficient history:

- Return `null` for the unavailable indicator.
- Do not throw.
- Include missing indicators in `dataQuality.missingIndicators` later in scanner output.

### 6.5 Bollinger Band Width formula

```txt
bandWidth = (upper - lower) / middle
```

If `middle` is zero or null, return null.

### 6.6 Width percentile

Calculate where the current width sits relative to the last 90 valid widths.

Example:

```txt
current width is lower than 15% of recent widths
=> widthPercentile = 15
```

Low percentile means volatility compression.

### 6.7 Price extension from MA20

```txt
extension = (close - ma20) / ma20
```

Return decimal value, not percentage string.

Example:

```txt
0.08 means price is 8% above MA20.
```

## 7. Scanner and Scoring Layer

### 7.1 Files

```txt
src/lib/scanner/types.ts
src/lib/scanner/marketPhase.ts
src/lib/scanner/scoring.ts
src/lib/scanner/riskFilters.ts
src/lib/scanner/explanations.ts
src/lib/scanner/multiTimeframe.ts
src/lib/scanner/scanMarket.ts
```

### 7.2 Scanner goals

The scanner must not simply return indicator values. It must classify each market into a meaningful state and explain the classification.

For each symbol, produce:

- Market phase
- Opportunity score
- Confirmation score
- Risk score
- Rank score
- Reasons
- Warnings
- Next confirmation
- Invalidation

---

## 8. Market Phase Model

### 8.1 BASE_BUILDING

Meaning:

- Price is moving sideways.
- Volatility is relatively low.
- Price is not yet breaking out.

Typical conditions:

- Price near MA20 or Bollinger middle band
- Bollinger width below average
- RSI between 40 and 60
- No strong volume expansion

### 8.2 SQUEEZE

Meaning:

- Volatility compression.
- Potential pre-breakout structure.
- Good observation candidate, but not confirmed.

Typical conditions:

- Bollinger width percentile below 20
- MA20 and MA50 close together
- Price near Bollinger middle band
- Volume quiet or normal

### 8.3 BREAKOUT_ATTEMPT

Meaning:

- Price is trying to move out of compression or resistance.
- Needs volume and close confirmation.

Typical conditions:

- Close near or above upper Bollinger Band
- RSI above 55
- Volume ratio rising
- MA20 flattening or turning up

### 8.4 BREAKOUT_CONFIRMED

Meaning:

- Breakout has stronger confirmation.
- Still not a buy recommendation.

Typical conditions:

- Close above upper Bollinger Band
- Volume ratio above 1.5
- MA20 above or crossing MA50
- RSI between 55 and 72

### 8.5 TRENDING

Meaning:

- Market is already in an uptrend.

Typical conditions:

- Price > MA20 > MA50
- Price > MA200
- RSI between 50 and 70
- Pullbacks remain controlled

### 8.6 PULLBACK_HEALTHY

Meaning:

- Uptrend remains valid, but price is pulling back.

Typical conditions:

- Price above MA50 or MA200
- Price near MA20 or Bollinger middle band
- RSI above 45
- No breakdown volume

### 8.7 OVEREXTENDED

Meaning:

- Price may be too far from mean.
- Chasing risk is high.

Typical conditions:

- RSI above 75
- Price far above MA20
- Volume spike after a large candle
- Close far above upper Bollinger Band

### 8.8 DISTRIBUTION

Meaning:

- Possible weakening after a strong move.

Typical conditions:

- High volume but weak close
- Long upper wick
- RSI divergence optional later
- Price falls back under Bollinger middle band after expansion

### 8.9 BREAKDOWN

Meaning:

- Bearish or structurally weak state.

Typical conditions:

- Price below MA50 or MA200
- RSI weak
- High sell volume
- Bollinger lower band expansion

---

## 9. Scoring Model

### 9.1 Score outputs

For every result:

```txt
opportunityScore: 0-100
confirmationScore: 0-100
riskScore: 0-100
rankScore: derived value
```

### 9.2 Opportunity score

Opportunity score measures whether the symbol is worth observing.

Add points for:

- Bollinger width percentile below 20
- MA20 and MA50 convergence
- Price near Bollinger middle band
- RSI not overextended
- Quiet volume compression or volume dry-up during compression
- Healthy pullback with contracted volume
- Sufficient candle history

Example logic:

```txt
+30 if BB width percentile < 20
+20 if MA20 and MA50 are within 2%
+15 if price is near Bollinger middle band
+10 if RSI between 40 and 65
+10 if volume ratio between 0.6 and 1.2 during compression
+10 if BB compression aligns with quiet volume or volume dry-up
+10 if a healthy pullback has contracted volume
+15 if trend context is not broken
```

Cap weak structures so compression alone does not create a high opportunity score:

- `BREAKDOWN` phase caps `opportunityScore` at 40.
- Price below both MA50 and MA200 caps `opportunityScore` at 50 unless recovery confirmation is present.
- Keep compression reasons visible, but add a weak-compression warning when price remains below key trend levels.

### 9.3 Confirmation score

Confirmation score measures whether the setup is already being confirmed.

Add points for:

- Close above upper Bollinger Band
- Breakout volume confirmed
- Volume expansion in constructive phases
- MA20 > MA50
- Price > MA200
- RSI between 55 and 72
- MACD confirmation when available

Example logic:

```txt
+25 if close > upper Bollinger Band
+20 if breakout volume is confirmed
+10 if volume expands in a constructive phase
+10 if volume expands while price is above MA50 and MA200
+20 if MA20 > MA50
+15 if price > MA200
+15 if RSI is between 55 and 72
```

### 9.4 Risk score

Risk score measures danger, overextension, or weak structure.

Add points for:

- RSI > 75
- Price far above MA20
- Price below MA50 or MA200
- Breakout without volume
- Abnormal volume spike with extension or overextended RSI
- Distribution-like volume warning
- High-volume breakdown below MA50/MA200
- Long upper wick
- Insufficient history
- Market regime weak

Example logic:

```txt
+25 if RSI > 75
+20 if price extension from MA20 > 8%
+20 if price < MA50
+25 if close > upper Bollinger Band but volumeRatio < 1.2
+20 if distribution-like volume appears
+20 if high volume confirms a breakdown below key averages
+10 if candle history is insufficient
```

### 9.5 Rank score

Use rankScore for sorting only.

Initial formula:

```txt
rankScore =
  opportunityScore * 0.40 +
  confirmationScore * 0.40 -
  riskScore * 0.30 -
  phase/risk penalties
```

Clamp the final value between 0 and 100.

Important:

> Never hide the three underlying scores. Display all of them.

## 10. Risk Filters

### 10.1 Fake breakout risk

Add warning if:

- Price breaks above upper Bollinger Band but volume ratio < 1.2
- RSI > 75
- Current candle has a long upper wick
- Price extension from MA20 is too high
- 4h signal conflicts with 1d trend later

Example warning:

```txt
Possible fake breakout: price moved above the upper Bollinger Band without strong volume confirmation.
```

### 10.2 Overextension risk

Add warning if:

- RSI > 75
- Price extension from MA20 > 8% on 4h
- Price extension from MA20 > 15% on 1d

Example warning:

```txt
Price is extended from MA20; chasing risk is elevated.
```

### 10.3 Weak structure risk

Add warning if:

- Price below MA50
- Price below MA200
- RSI below 45
- Volume rising while price is falling

Example warning:

```txt
Trend structure is weak because price is below MA50.
```

---

## 11. Explanation Layer

Every scan result must include explanation arrays.

### 11.1 reasons[]

Explain why the symbol ranked.

Examples:

```txt
Bollinger Band width is in the lower 20% of recent candles.
MA20 and MA50 are converging.
Price is holding near the Bollinger middle band.
Volume is quiet, consistent with compression.
```

### 11.2 warnings[]

Explain risks.

Examples:

```txt
RSI is above 75, which may indicate overextension.
Breakout attempt lacks volume confirmation.
Daily trend is not confirmed yet.
Price is below MA200, so long-term trend remains weak.
```

### 11.3 nextConfirmation[]

Explain what should happen next.

Examples:

```txt
Watch for a 4H close above the upper Bollinger Band.
Volume ratio should rise above 1.5.
RSI should remain below 72 during confirmation.
Price should remain above MA50.
```

### 11.4 invalidation[]

Explain what would invalidate the setup.

Examples:

```txt
Invalidated if price closes below MA50 on the 4H timeframe.
Invalidated if price falls back below the Bollinger middle band with rising volume.
Invalidated if BTC daily market regime turns weak.
```

## 12. API Routes

### 12.1 `/api/markets`

Purpose:

- Return filtered Binance USDT spot markets.

Query params:

```txt
limit optional
```

Response:

```ts
{
  exchange: "binance";
  markets: Market[];
  itemCount: number;
  cached: boolean;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### 12.2 `/api/candles`

Purpose:

- Return normalized candle data for one symbol.

Query params:

```txt
symbol=BTCUSDT
timeframe=4h
limit=300
```

Response:

```ts
{
  exchange: "binance";
  symbol: string;
  timeframe: Timeframe;
  candles: Candle[];
  itemCount: number;
  cached: boolean;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### 12.3 `/api/scan`

Purpose:

- Scan the eligible Binance Spot USDT market universe and return ranked results.

Query params:

```txt
source=remote
timeframe=4h
maxSymbols=all
minQuoteVolume=0

    excludedStableOrLeveraged: number;
  };
  batchMode?: true;
  cursor?: number;
  nextCursor?: number | null;
  hasMore?: boolean;
  batchSize?: number;
  batchIndex?: number;
  totalBatches?: number;
  totalEligibleCount?: number;
  scannedInBatch?: number;
  results: ScanResult[];
  itemCount: number;
  errors?: {
    symbol: string;
    message: string;
  }[];
  cached: boolean;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### 12.4 `/api/scan/mtf`

Purpose:

- Scan the same eligible universe across a preset group of timeframes and return merged MTF results.

Query params:

```txt
source=remote
preset=short
maxSymbols=all
minQuoteVolume=0
batchMode=true
batchSize=15
cursor=0
```

MTF full-market scans should use `batchMode=true` on Cloudflare Workers Free. The response includes the same batch metadata as `/api/scan`, plus `mode: "mtf"`, `preset`, `timeframes`, `primaryTimeframe`, and `confirmationTimeframe`.

### 12.5 Error handling

One symbol failure must not fail the whole scan.

If a symbol fails:

- Skip it.
- Add it to `errors`.
- Return partial results.

---

## 13. Caching and Performance

### 13.1 MVP cache

Use simple in-memory server-side cache first.

Files:

```txt
src/lib/cache/memory.ts
src/lib/cache/keys.ts
```

### 13.2 Cache TTL

Use:

```txt
markets / exchangeInfo: 12 hours
tickers: 30 minutes
candles 4h: 60 minutes
candles 1d: 6 hours
candles 1w: 24 hours
candles 1M: 72 hours
scan 4h: 60 minutes
scan 1d: 6 hours
scan 1w: 24 hours
scan 1M: 72 hours
```

### 13.3 Cache keys

```txt
markets:binance:spot:usdt
tickers:binance:24h
candles:binance:{symbol}:{timeframe}:{limit}
scan:binance:{timeframe}:{limit}
```

### 13.4 Concurrency control

Use `p-limit`.

Default scan concurrency:

```txt
5
```

Do not use unrestricted:

```ts
Promise.all(markets.map(...))
```

Use:

```ts
const limit = pLimit(5);
const results = await Promise.all(
  markets.map((market) => limit(() => scanSymbol(market)))
);
```

### 13.5 Future production cache

Later, replace memory cache with:

- Upstash Redis
- Redis on Railway/Fly.io
- Cloudflare KV if deployed in Cloudflare ecosystem

But do not add Redis in MVP unless necessary.

Do not implement scanner logic yet.

After implementation:
- run lint
- run build
- report changed files
```

---

## 24. Prompt for Codex — Phase 3

```txt
Implement the indicator calculation layer.

Use technicalindicators only inside src/lib/indicators.
Do not call technicalindicators from pages, API routes, or scanner logic directly.

Create:
src/lib/indicators/types.ts
src/lib/indicators/movingAverage.ts
src/lib/indicators/bollinger.ts
src/lib/indicators/rsi.ts
src/lib/indicators/volume.ts
src/lib/indicators/index.ts

Implement:
- SMA 20 / 50 / 200
- Bollinger Bands with period 20 and stdDev 2
- Bollinger Band Width
- Bollinger Band Width percentile over the last 90 valid width values
- RSI 14
- Volume MA20
- Volume ratio = current volume / volumeMA20
- Price extension from MA20

Create a function:
calculateIndicatorSnapshot(candles: Candle[]): IndicatorSnapshot

Rules:
- Return null for indicators when there is not enough data
- Do not throw for short candle arrays
- Keep calculations pure and testable
- Add comments explaining assumptions

Do not implement scanner scoring yet.

After implementation:
- run lint
- run build
- report changed files
```

---

## 25. Prompt for Codex — Phase 4

```txt
Implement the scanner scoring layer.

Create:
src/lib/scanner/types.ts
src/lib/scanner/marketPhase.ts
src/lib/scanner/scoring.ts
src/lib/scanner/riskFilters.ts
src/lib/scanner/explanations.ts
src/lib/scanner/scanMarket.ts

Use the existing exchange layer and indicator layer.

For each symbol:
1. Fetch candles
2. Calculate indicator snapshot
3. Determine market phase
4. Calculate:
   - opportunityScore
   - confirmationScore
   - riskScore
   - rankScore
5. Generate:
   - reasons[]
   - warnings[]
   - nextConfirmation[]
   - invalidation[]

Market phases:
- BASE_BUILDING
- SQUEEZE
- BREAKOUT_ATTEMPT
- BREAKOUT_CONFIRMED
- TRENDING
- PULLBACK_HEALTHY
- OVEREXTENDED
- DISTRIBUTION
- BREAKDOWN

Scoring guidelines:
- SQUEEZE: high opportunity when Bollinger Band width percentile is low and MA20/MA50 are close
- BREAKOUT_ATTEMPT: high confirmation when close is above upper Bollinger Band and volume ratio > 1.5
- TRENDING: price > MA20 > MA50 and price > MA200
- PULLBACK_HEALTHY: price near MA20 or Bollinger middle band while trend remains intact
- OVEREXTENDED: RSI > 75 or price is far above MA20
- BREAKDOWN: price below MA50/MA200 with weak RSI or high sell volume

Add risk warnings:
- RSI above 75
- volume does not confirm breakout
- price too extended from MA20
- insufficient candle history
- low liquidity if available

Create /api/scan?timeframe=4h&limit=100

Implementation requirements:
- Use p-limit to limit concurrent candle fetches
- Sort results by rankScore descending
- Return JSON
- Add basic error handling per symbol so one failed symbol does not fail the whole scan

Do not build the full UI yet.

After implementation:
- run lint
- run build
- report changed files

---

## 28. Prompt for Codex — Phase 7

```txt
Add caching and performance safeguards.

Create:
src/lib/cache/memory.ts
src/lib/cache/keys.ts

Implement simple server-side memory cache:
- markets / exchangeInfo: 12 hours
- tickers: 30 minutes
- candles 4h: 60 minutes
- candles 1d: 6 hours
- candles 1w: 24 hours
- candles 1M: 72 hours
- scan 4h: 60 minutes
- scan 1d: 6 hours
- scan 1w: 24 hours
- scan 1M: 72 hours

Add cache keys:
- markets:binance:spot:usdt
- tickers:binance:24h
- candles:binance:{symbol}:{timeframe}:{limit}
- scan:binance:{timeframe}:{limit}

Add response metadata:
- cached
- updatedAt
- itemCount

Add concurrency protection:
- Use p-limit when scanning symbols
- Default concurrency: 5
- Do not use Promise.all without concurrency limit for large scans

Add graceful degradation:
- If one symbol fails, collect the error and continue
- Return partial results with warnings if necessary

After implementation:
- run lint
- run build
- report changed files
```

---

## 31. Future Roadmap

### v2

- Watchlist with localStorage
- Multi-timeframe alignment
- BTC/ETH market regime filter
- Better liquidity tiers
- Better chart annotations

### v3

- PostgreSQL + Prisma
- Historical signal snapshots
- Backtesting
- Watchlist alerts
- Coinbase / Kraken / OKX support through exchange adapter or CCXT

### v4

- User accounts
- Saved strategy templates
- Custom scoring weights
- Signal performance analytics

---

## 32. Final Direction

The first version should be narrow, stable, and useful.

Do not attempt to build a full trading platform.

The MVP should answer one question well:

> “Among the top Binance USDT spot pairs, which coins currently have a technical structure worth observing, why, what confirms it, and what invalidates it?”

---

# Appendix: GitHub / Open-Source Reuse Strategy

The following section explains which existing GitHub projects and libraries should be used, referenced, or avoided.

---

This addendum explains which existing GitHub projects/libraries should be used or referenced for the Crypto Technical Scanner project, and which ones should not be used as the project base.

## Core Decision

Do not fork a full crypto trading bot as the project foundation.

Instead, build our own Next.js product structure and reuse mature open-source libraries for specific modules:

- Technical indicators
- Candlestick charting
- Market-data abstraction
- Optional future backtesting
- Optional future alerts

The product we are building is a technical screening and research tool, not an automated trading bot.

---

## Recommended Reuse Strategy

### Use libraries as dependencies

These can be installed through npm and wrapped inside our own abstraction layers.

1. `lightweight-charts`
2. `technicalindicators` or `trading-signals`
3. `ccxt` in v2, not required for v1
4. `p-limit`
5. `@tanstack/react-table`
6. `@tanstack/react-query`

### Reference code patterns only

These repositories may be studied for ideas, but should not be copied wholesale:

1. `CryptoSignal/Crypto-Signal`
2. `chrisleekr/binance-trading-bot`
3. `keithorange/CryptoSuperScreener`
4. `botcrypto-io/awesome-crypto-trading-bots`

---

## Recommended Libraries

### 1. TradingView Lightweight Charts

Repository:

`tradingview/lightweight-charts`

Use for:

- Candlestick charts
- MA overlays
- Bollinger Band overlays
- Signal markers on chart
- Future chart annotations

Why use it:

- Small and fast financial charting library
- Strong fit for browser-based financial tools
- Better than building charting from scratch
- Suitable for a clean technical scanner UI

How to use:

Install:

```bash
npm install lightweight-charts
```

Create our wrapper:

```txt
src/components/chart/CandleChart.tsx
src/components/chart/chartData.ts
src/components/chart/indicatorSeries.ts
```

Rules:

- Do not put chart logic directly into page files.
- Build a stable wrapper so chart implementation can evolve later.
- First version only needs candles + MA + Bollinger Bands.

---

### 2. technicalindicators

Repository:

`anandanand84/technicalindicators`

Use for MVP indicator calculations:

- SMA
- EMA if needed later
- RSI
- MACD if needed later
- Bollinger Bands
- Candlestick patterns, optional future use

Why use it:

- Simple and mature JavaScript/TypeScript technical indicator library
- Easy for Codex to understand
- Enough for MVP

Concern:

- The project is older and may not be as actively maintained as newer alternatives.
- Therefore, do not couple the whole app directly to this library.

How to use:

Install:

```bash
npm install technicalindicators
```

Wrap it:

```txt
src/lib/indicators/movingAverage.ts
src/lib/indicators/bollinger.ts
src/lib/indicators/rsi.ts
src/lib/indicators/volume.ts
src/lib/indicators/index.ts
```

Important rule:

No page, component, API route, or scanner logic should import `technicalindicators` directly.

Only files inside `src/lib/indicators/` may import it.

---

### 3. trading-signals

Repository:

`bennycode/trading-signals`

Use as an alternative to `technicalindicators`, or as a future upgrade.

Potential use:

- Streaming-style indicators
- Modular strategy concepts
- More TypeScript-native signal logic
- Future backtesting or strategy abstraction inspiration

Why consider it:

- Fully typed
- Modular
- Designed around indicators and strategy concepts
- Closer to the direction of a signal-scanning system

Concern:

- It also includes bot-related concepts, so we should not adopt the whole bot stack.
- Use only indicator and signal abstractions that fit our scanner.

Recommendation:

For v1, use either:

```txt
Option A: technicalindicators for simplicity
Option B: trading-signals if Codex finds it straightforward
```

But always hide the choice behind our own indicator wrapper.

---

### 4. CCXT

Repository:

`ccxt/ccxt`

Use in v2, not required in v1.

Use for:

- Multi-exchange support
- Binance / Coinbase / Kraken / OKX / Bybit unified market data
- Future exchange adapter layer

Do not use in v1 unless needed.

Why not v1:

- We only need Binance Spot public data first.
- Direct Binance API is simpler and easier to debug.
- CCXT adds abstraction weight before we need it.

Recommended path:

v1:

```txt
src/lib/exchanges/binance.ts
```

v2:

```txt
src/lib/exchanges/ccxt.ts
src/lib/exchanges/coinbase.ts
src/lib/exchanges/okx.ts
```

Keep this interface from day one:

```ts
export interface ExchangeAdapter {
  getMarkets(): Promise<Market[]>;
  getTickers(): Promise<Ticker[]>;
  getCandles(symbol: string, timeframe: Timeframe, limit: number): Promise<Candle[]>;
}
```

---

## Repositories to Study but Not Fork

### 1. CryptoSignal/Crypto-Signal

Repository:

`CryptoSignal/Crypto-Signal`

What it does:

- Command-line crypto technical analysis automation
- Tracks many coins across several exchanges
- Includes indicators such as RSI, SMA, MACD, MFI, OBV, VWAP
- Includes alert channels such as SMS, email, Slack, Telegram, Discord

Can borrow ideas from:

- Indicator grouping
- Alert concepts
- Multi-exchange mindset
- Signal naming
- Configuration style

Do not borrow:

- CLI-first architecture
- Bot-style product positioning
- Alert-heavy structure for MVP
- Any assumption that the app is a trading signal bot

Use only as reference.

---

### 2. chrisleekr/binance-trading-bot

Repository:

`chrisleekr/binance-trading-bot`

What it does:

- Automated Binance trading bot
- Grid trading
- Manual trade
- Stop-loss
- Multi-coin monitoring
- TradingView technical analysis integration

Can borrow ideas from:

- Binance monitoring patterns
- Symbol filtering
- Risk warning ideas
- Configuration naming

Do not borrow:

- Order placement
- Buy/sell flow
- Wallet or private API key handling
- Grid trading logic
- Trading bot UI assumptions

This project is too close to an automated trading product and should not be the foundation.

---

### 3. keithorange/CryptoSuperScreener

Repository:

`keithorange/CryptoSuperScreener`

What it does:

- Crypto screener concept
- CCXT-based multi-exchange direction
- Grid-watching charts

Can borrow ideas from:

- Screener UX
- Multi-chart monitoring
- CCXT direction for future versions

Do not borrow:

- Whole architecture
- Plotly-first charting if we prefer Lightweight Charts
- Older or less maintained code without review

Use as a product reference only.

### 4. botcrypto-io/awesome-crypto-trading-bots

Repository:

`botcrypto-io/awesome-crypto-trading-bots`

What it is:

- A curated list of crypto trading bots, technical analysis libraries, market data libraries, API/data providers, and charting libraries.

Use for:

- Researching alternative libraries
- Future comparison
- Finding backtesting frameworks later

Important caution:

The repository itself says tools are not checked or tested and should be used at your own risk.

## Strong Recommendation

Use this combination for the MVP:

```txt
Framework:
- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript

Market data:
- Direct Binance public REST API

Indicators:
- technicalindicators, wrapped by our own indicator layer

Charts:
- tradingview/lightweight-charts

Table:
- TanStack Table

Client data fetching:
- TanStack Query

Concurrency:
- p-limit

Cache:
- memory cache first
- Upstash Redis later
```

Do not use a full GitHub trading bot as the base.

---

## Why Not Fork a Full Bot?

Because most crypto bot repositories are optimized for:

- Trading
- Order placement
- API keys
- Telegram alerts
- Grid strategies
- Stop-loss / take-profit
- Bot configuration
- Server processes

Our project is optimized for:

- Web UI
- Technical screening
- Explainable ranking
- Market phase classification
- Multi-timeframe research
- No private keys
- No trading execution
- No financial advice language

The product goals are different.

Forking a trading bot would create more cleanup work than value.

## Codex Instruction: Reuse Policy

Add this instruction to every Codex task:

```txt
Reuse mature open-source libraries where appropriate, but do not fork or copy a full trading bot architecture.

Allowed dependencies:
- lightweight-charts
- technicalindicators or trading-signals
- @tanstack/react-table
- @tanstack/react-query
- p-limit
- ccxt only in v2 or later

Rules:
- Do not implement order placement.
- Do not connect wallets.
- Do not request private exchange API keys.
- Do not use Buy/Sell/Strong Buy language.
- Do not copy large blocks of code from trading bot repositories.
- If borrowing logic from a repository, clearly state the source and adapt it into our own architecture.
- Keep indicator calculations behind src/lib/indicators.
- Keep exchange access behind src/lib/exchanges.
- Keep scoring and product-specific signal logic inside src/lib/scanner.
```

## Codex Task: Evaluate Dependencies Before Installing

Before installing any external library, Codex should report:

```txt
1. Package name
2. Why it is needed
3. Which internal wrapper will isolate it
4. License
5. Whether it introduces trading/order/security risk
```

Example:

```txt
Package: lightweight-charts
Need: interactive candlestick chart rendering
Wrapper: src/components/chart/CandleChart.tsx
License: Apache-2.0
Trading/security risk: none
```

---

## MVP Dependency Decision

Use this by default:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lightweight-charts": "latest",
    "technicalindicators": "latest",
    "@tanstack/react-table": "latest",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "latest",
    "p-limit": "latest"
  }
}
```

Do not add:

```txt
ccxt
bullmq
prisma
telegram bot libraries
exchange private API clients
wallet libraries
```

until a later phase explicitly requires them.

---

## Final Position

Yes, we should use existing GitHub/open-source code.

But we should use it as:

```txt
mature libraries + reference patterns
```

not as:

```txt
forked trading bot base
```

The best implementation path is:

```txt
Own Next.js scanner architecture
+ lightweight-charts for charts
+ technicalindicators/trading-signals for indicators
+ Binance public API adapter
+ TanStack Table for scanner UI
+ p-limit and cache for stability
```

This gives us speed without inheriting the wrong product structure.
