# VegaRank UI Copy System

## 1. Purpose

VegaRank UI shell copy should read as a professional crypto technical research-ranking product. The interface must describe rankings, research snapshots, validation context, and manual review without implying trading advice, execution, or prediction.

Persistent disclaimer: `Research-only. Not trading advice.`

This document governs visible UI shell copy only. It does not rename API fields, database columns, storage keys, codebook values, scoring formulas, PM2 processes, cron jobs, or deployment runtime names.

## 2. Page roles

- Market Rankings: latest ranked research results across the current market universe.
- Multi-Timeframe Screener: joined multi-timeframe research snapshots across supported timeframes.
- Watchlist: selected symbols monitored against the latest research snapshot.
- Research Archive: stored runs, archive snapshots, maturity, and validation context.
- Symbol Research: single-symbol research snapshot with current context, multi-timeframe context, timeline, validation, behavior, and related runs.

## 3. Button standards

- Use verb plus object where space allows: `Refresh Rankings`, `Refresh Screener`, `Refresh Watchlist`, `Refresh Archive`, `Refresh Research`.
- Use `Open Research` for symbol research navigation.
- Use `View Details` and `Close` for local detail panels.
- Use `Clear Filters`, `Reset View`, `Add to Watchlist`, and `Remove from Watchlist`.
- Avoid vague labels such as `Open`, `Check`, or `Details` when a specific action is available.

## 4. Filter standards

Preferred labels include:

- `Timeframe`
- `Asset Class`
- `Research Group`
- `Research Priority`
- `Setup`
- `Risk Context`
- `Evidence Quality`
- `Rank Score`
- `Confidence`
- `Volume / Liquidity`
- `Search Symbol`
- `Exchange`
- `Market`
- `Sort By`
- `Show Low Quality`
- `Show High Priority`

Filters may continue to display codebook meanings through `explainCode` and `explainCodes`. Do not hard-code codebook explanations in component shell copy.

## 5. Table column standards

Common visible columns:

- `Rank`
- `Symbol`
- `Timeframe`
- `Research Group`
- `Research Priority`
- `Setup`
- `Risk Context`
- `Evidence Quality`
- `Rank Score`
- `Risk-Adjusted Score`
- `Setup Quality`
- `Confidence`
- `Trend`
- `Momentum`
- `Structure`
- `Volatility`
- `Liquidity`
- `Updated`
- `Snapshot`
- `Run`
- `Open Research`

Do not expose camelCase metric names. Do not rename API response fields or sort/filter keys.

## 6. Status/loading/empty/error states

Preferred loading states:

- `Loading rankings...`
- `Loading research snapshot...`
- `Loading archive runs...`
- `Loading symbol research...`
- `Loading watchlist...`

Preferred empty states:

- `No ranking results found.`
- `No symbols match the current filters.`
- `No watchlist symbols yet.`
- `No archived runs available.`
- `No validation outcomes available yet.`
- `No research snapshot is available for this symbol.`

Preferred error states:

- `Unable to load rankings.`
- `Unable to load research snapshot.`
- `Unable to load archive data.`
- `Unable to load symbol research.`
- `Unable to load watchlist.`
- `Try refreshing the page or adjusting filters.`

## 7. Archive wording

Use:

- `Research Archive`
- `Stored Runs`
- `Selected Run`
- `Archive Snapshot`
- `Snapshot Rows`
- `Outcome Summary`
- `Validation Readiness`
- `Source Data`
- `Maturity Logic`
- `Setup Evolution`
- `Completed Candles`
- `Future Window`

Avoid visible copy such as `History`, `Selected Scan`, `Scan Rows`, `Scan History`, `Historical trades`, `Trading outcome`, and `Profit outcome`.

## 8. Rankings wording

Use:

- `Market Rankings`
- `Latest Rankings`
- `Ranked Universe`
- `Ranking Summary`
- `Ranking Results`
- `Selected Result`
- `Result Details`
- `Research Group`
- `Research Priority`
- `Risk Context`
- `Evidence Quality`
- `Filtered Results`

Avoid visible copy such as `Scanner`, `Scanner Output`, `Latest Scan`, `Scan Result`, `Filtered Signals`, and `Raw Scanner Signal`.

## 9. Symbol Research wording

Use:

- `Research Snapshot`
- `Current Context`
- `Multi-Timeframe Context`
- `Timeline`
- `Validation`
- `Behavior`
- `Risk Context`
- `Evidence Quality`
- `Related Runs`

Avoid trading-advice language and prediction framing.

## 10. Forbidden terms

Do not introduce these terms in visible UI shell copy:

- `buy`
- `sell`
- `long`
- `short`
- `entry`
- `exit`
- `take profit`
- `stop loss`
- `profit target`
- `guaranteed`
- `alpha call`
- `moon`
- `pump`
- `trade signal`
- `trading signal`
- `strong buy`
- `must buy`
- `perfect setup`

Technical runtime names, API paths, DB fields, storage keys, and historical documentation may still contain legacy terms when renaming them would change behavior or contract semantics.

## 11. CSV/export decision

This phase updates low-risk export labels and generated filenames where the UI controls the copy:

- rankings export label: `Export Rankings`
- screener export label: `Export Screener`
- watchlist import/export label: `Import / Export Watchlist`
- generated filenames: `vegarank-rankings-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, `vegarank-screener-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

CSV column headers are updated only where tests and consumers are clearly internal. Remaining contract-like CSV field names should be handled as a Phase 24 compatibility review.

## 12. Relationship to English/Chinese codebooks

The UI shell copy system sits above the Phase 20 professional English codebook and Phase 21 Chinese terminology system.

- Components may format code meanings through codebook helpers.
- This phase must not rewrite codebook dictionary semantics.
- Direct Chinese shell mappings may be updated only when the mapping is already supported and local.
- A full Chinese shell pass remains a separate follow-up.

## 13. Follow-up items

- Audit CSV columns and any downstream consumers before broader export header changes.
- Complete a direct Chinese shell copy pass for labels touched in this phase.
- Review legacy components that are not part of the current cutover routes before deleting or rewriting them.
- Continue classifying remaining legacy terms as internal implementation, API contract, DB/runtime naming, test coverage, historical documentation, or visible copy.
