# Market Data Source Strategy

Persistent disclaimer: VegaRank is a research-ranking system. It is not trading
advice, exchange recommendation, arbitrage software, portfolio management, alerting
software, or trading performance software.

## Phase 32K Scope

Phase 32K evaluates market data source strategy before any Coinbase production
cron expansion. It does not change scoring, database schema, migrations, production
cron, UI, Archive, Watchlist, or current Binance/Coinbase runtime behavior.

Current Coinbase manual pipeline status:

- Coinbase supplemental import, backfill, and scanner runs work manually.
- Full manual rollout covered 179 Coinbase-only USDC symbols.
- Coinbase `4h` manual scan saw `symbolsTotal=179`, `symbolsScanned=89`, and
  `symbolsSkipped=90`.
- Coinbase `1d` manual scan saw `symbolsTotal=179`, `symbolsScanned=139`, and
  `symbolsSkipped=40`.
- Binance production latest rankings remain unaffected.

The skipped Coinbase rows are not accepted as normal production behavior. They
are a decision gate: VegaRank should evaluate provider coverage before continuing
Coinbase productionization.

## VegaRank Data Needs

VegaRank needs OHLCV candles with:

- intervals: `1h`, `4h`, `1d`, and `1w`
- at least 200 candles for scoring readiness
- exchange, market, symbol, base asset, and quote asset identity
- quote asset distinction, especially USDT versus USDC
- stable update cadence and explicit rate-limit handling
- gap reporting for missing source intervals
- source provenance for provider, exchange, market, interval, and derived status
- future expansion path beyond crypto, including equities, ETFs, and macro data

Source identity matters. Coin-level aggregated candles must not be silently mixed
with exchange-specific candles. If a future source provides aggregated `BTC` data,
that series is not interchangeable with Binance `BTCUSDT` or Coinbase `BTC-USDC`
without an explicit source label and product decision.

## Provider Evaluation Criteria

Evaluate each provider on:

- free tier availability and paid cost
- historical depth for at least 200 candles per interval
- support for `1h`, native `4h`, native `1d`, and native `1w`
- exchange-specific candles versus aggregated coin-level candles
- Coinbase pair support, Binance pair support, and USDC pair support
- rate limits and pagination model
- data licensing and Terms of Service risk
- operational reliability and documented error behavior
- gap behavior and missing-candle diagnostics
- product metadata quality
- future equities support

Unverified capabilities should remain `needs_verification` until a live capability
audit proves them against representative VegaRank symbols.

## Recommended Architecture

Add a provider registry that treats each market data source as a capability profile,
not just an implementation module. The registry should expose:

- provider id and provider type
- exchange-specific versus aggregated-only semantics
- interval support and whether candles are native or derived
- market and quote-asset support
- free-tier, licensing, rate-limit, and pagination notes
- intended role: primary, fallback, audit candidate, metadata, manual import, or unsuitable

Future storage should add source provenance with candles before mixing providers
inside production workflows. Provenance should eventually record:

- provider id
- exchange and market
- raw symbol and provider symbol
- interval
- native versus derived candle status
- source interval when derived
- retrieval time or batch id

Primary/fallback policy should prefer exchange-specific native candles. Aggregation
is a fallback only when:

- the provider lacks the native interval
- lower-interval coverage is complete enough
- the derived candle is explicitly labeled as derived
- gap diagnostics prove enough history for scoring

VegaRank should avoid hand-aggregating as the default strategy. Manual `4h`
aggregation from `1h` is acceptable as a controlled fallback, not as evidence that
Coinbase production coverage is solved.

## Recommended Near-Term Path

Do not immediately replace Binance. Do not immediately cron Coinbase.

First run a provider capability audit against a representative sample:

- current Binance production symbols
- the Coinbase-only USDC symbols that scanned successfully
- the Coinbase-only USDC symbols that skipped on `4h`
- the Coinbase-only USDC symbols that skipped on `1d`
- high-volume, medium-volume, and low-history pairs

The audit should measure:

- whether each provider returns at least 200 candles for each required interval
- whether `4h` and `1w` are native or derived
- source gaps and duplicate timestamps
- pair identity and quote preservation
- rate-limit behavior
- licensing and plan fit

Phase 32L adds this live read-only audit as
`pnpm market-data:providers:live-audit`. It probes Coinbase Advanced Direct,
CryptoCompare, CryptoDataDownload, and CoinGecko without DB writes, scanner runs,
cron changes, scoring changes, or UI changes. See
`docs/live-crypto-ohlcv-provider-audit.md`.

Recommended next phase: Phase 32L - Coinbase Advanced Direct vs third-party
OHLCV comparison.
