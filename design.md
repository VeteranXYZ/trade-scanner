# Trade Scanner Design System

## Product UI Principle

Trade Scanner is a desktop-first professional research terminal. The interface is dense but readable, and it supports structured observation over prediction. UI copy and layout must make the product feel like a research workspace, not an execution platform or financial-advice product.

The app should prioritize evidence, context, scanner state, and follow-up checks. It should avoid hype, profit framing, and trading-call language.

## Layout System

The app shell uses a compact global header above page-specific workspaces. Terminal pages should preserve key context near the top while allowing the main workspace to scroll normally.

Use sticky command/context bars for pages where users compare data while scrolling. Sticky regions must stay compact and should include only the information needed to preserve orientation: current symbol or result set, exchange, timeframe, asset class, quality, latest timestamp, current state, and the primary reason or rank summary.

Desktop research layouts use a fixed grid structure:

- Primary workspace: chart, table, or main data surface.
- Analysis column: explanation, score interpretation, and next checks.
- Context rail: market backdrop, history, timeline, and secondary details.

Screener pages follow a full-table philosophy. The table is the product surface, so filters, status bars, and detail panels should support table scanning rather than compete with it.

## Visual Hierarchy

The hierarchy is:

1. Primary decision or status.
2. Chart, table, or data workspace.
3. Explanation and checks.
4. Context rail.
5. Diagnostics and raw data.

Diagnostics, raw JSON, source metadata, and broad detail tables are lowest priority. Keep them collapsed by default unless a phase explicitly asks for diagnostic-first work.

## Density Rules

Use compact cards, short labels, tight row spacing, and concise English copy. Avoid repeated explanatory copy, decorative UI, nested cards, oversized headers inside tool surfaces, and unnecessary internal scrollbars.

Default page content should scroll at the page level. Internal scrollbars are reserved for raw diagnostics, expanded source data, very wide tables, or intentionally bounded raw panels.

## Desktop Height Balancing

Terminal workspaces should use the first desktop viewport deliberately. Avoid one long context rail while primary and analysis columns end early with dead space below them.

Columns should have comparable visual weight in the first desktop viewport. If one column becomes much longer, collapse lower-priority content or redistribute existing summary information into the analysis column. Do this with existing evidence, history, or context data rather than introducing new product concepts.

Chart compactness must not make the primary visual too short. Use responsive sizing such as clamp-based heights so the chart remains the dominant workspace on desktop without reintroducing viewport-locked page sections or default internal scrollbars.

## Color And Status Semantics

Colors support scanning and should not become decoration.

- Eligible, constructive, and supportive states use positive greens.
- Watch, mixed, and neutral states use muted or moderate tones.
- Risk, negative, and invalid states use red.
- Overheated or caution states use amber.
- Secondary metadata uses muted foreground colors.

Do not overuse saturated color. A status color should identify state, priority, or risk, not decorate a module.

## Table And List Rules

Tables should use compact row height, tabular numerals, clear active sort indicators, and right alignment for numeric values where practical. Missing and neutral states should be muted.

Lists should show the most important rows first. If a compact panel has more than a few items, show the top 3-4 by default and omit the rest unless the hidden content has clear user value. Do not add generic "more" expanders just to expose low-priority overflow.

The Screener should not default to a pagination or top-100 pattern. Full result visibility is the baseline unless performance or a specific phase requires otherwise.

## Symbol Research Rules

Symbol Research keeps the command bar and decision strip sticky on desktop. The sticky context should preserve symbol, exchange, timeframe, asset class, quality, latest timestamp, current decision/state, and the primary reason or rank summary.

The chart remains the primary visual element. Multi-timeframe context sits with the chart. Why and Check Next explain decision quality and next research steps. The right rail contains context modules: Backdrop, History, Timeline, and Details.

Timeline defaults to the most relevant recent rows and should not show an internal scrollbar in its compact state. Newer secondary-row notices should read as small status notes, not warning banners. Avoid generic "show more" controls in the rail; the compact rail should prioritize recent activity over exhaustive history.

Details and Raw Diagnostics stay collapsed by default and should remain visually lower priority than chart, explanation, and context modules.

## Screener Rules

The Screener is table-first. Keep full result visibility by default, with a compact sticky left filter rail on desktop. Filters should be efficient and low-friction; status and primary signal colors should improve scanning rather than decorate rows.

Avoid pagination-first layouts, oversized summary cards, or empty marketing sections. Preserve dense comparison workflows.

## Watchlist Rules

The Watchlist is a selected-symbol monitoring terminal. The selected-symbol table is primary; summary, attention, and backdrop context must stay compact and secondary. Use fixed terminal context where feasible so the command/status band remains visible during row review.

The left rail should prioritize Symbols, Presets, and Filters. Import/export is a secondary collapsed affordance and must not dominate permanent rail space. Avoid generic "show more" overflow controls.

Follow strict semantic color rules: blue is UI/system only, green is eligible/constructive, violet is watch/observation, red is risk, amber is hot/caution/data gap, and gray is neutral/missing/not found. Repair/recovery should not read as healthy green.

## Copy Rules

Use concise English UI copy. Prefer words like research, context, evidence, observation, state, quality, and check next.

Avoid financial advice language, hype, predictions, trading calls, and profit framing. Avoid direct execution language such as buy, sell, long, short, entry, exit, target, take profit, or stop loss in product UI unless documenting prohibited wording.

## Future UI Change Rules

New modules must justify their information priority. Do not add cards unless they reduce cognitive load or fit an established workspace role.

Prefer reorganizing existing information over adding new concepts. Preserve backend and data semantics unless a phase explicitly asks to change them.
